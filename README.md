# The Game of Pig!

A simple dice game ([Pig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_(dice_game))) where two players race to reach 100 points. On each turn, the current player repeatedly rolls a die until a "1" is rolled or the player decides to "hold":

- If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing, and it becomes the next player's turn.
- If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their “turn total,” and the player's turn continues.
- If a player chooses to "hold," their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.

The first player to score 100 or more points wins.

Please note, in the context of the Pig dice game, the "turn total" refers to the sum of all dice rolls a player makes during their current turn (unless they roll a 1, which resets the turn total to 0).

On the other hand, "score" refers to the total number of points a player has accumulated throughout the entire game. This includes points from previous turns as well as the current turn, provided the player decides to 'hold' and add their turn total to their score.
